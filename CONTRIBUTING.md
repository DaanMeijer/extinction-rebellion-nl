## Join the team

### Contact us

The first step in joining the website team is to [contact us](/SUPPORT.md) and
let us know that you would like to help out. We will then:

- Arrange an introduction call to get to know each other, tell you more about
  the website, help you figure out how to help out and answer any questions that
  you might have.
- Give you an invite to Mattermost, our internal communication platform, so that
  you can communicate with the rest of the team through our [website
  channel](https://organise.earth/xr-netherlands/channels/xrnl-website)
- Give you an invite to [our Trello](https://trello.com/b/4yGL5KAJ/xrnl-website),
  where we manage all our tasks.

### Join project meetings

Every other Thursday at 19:00 we hold a brief and efficient online meeting to
review the progress from the previous 2 weeks, resolve questions about current
work, discuss ideas and set goals for the next two weeks. We highly recommend
you attend these meetings so that you can get to know the team, participate in
discussions and volunteer for tasks that you're interested in. You can join the
online meeting using [this link](https://meet2.organise.earth/b/tec-wd7-zfg) on
the next week that lands on an [odd week
number](https://www.epochconverter.com/weeknumbers).

## Identify where to help out

In [our Trello](https://trello.com/b/4yGL5KAJ/xrnl-website) you can find the
complete list of things that we want to improve on the website. These criteria
might help you figure out where you can help out: 

- The right-most column has the tasks with the highest priority, and tasks
  higher up in each column usually have higher priority.
- These labels are used to indicate what work is needed and who could best help
  out:
  - `Wordpress`: content needs to be changed on the live site. Anyone with a
  website account can do this.
  - `Design`: a design is needed, which will then be coded into the website.
  Designers are needed for these tasks.
  - `Code`: the website code needs to be changed. Programmers are needed for
  these tasks.
- The `bug` label is used to indicate that somethig is broken and
  quickly needs to be fixed, the `enhancement` label indicates an existing
  functionality needs to be improved, and the `feature` label indicates that a
  new website functionality needs to be improved.

If you're still unsure what is most important or where your help is needed most,
you can always [contact us](/SUPPORT.md). 

Lastly, you're also very welcome to propose and implement your own ideas for
improving the website. 

### How tasks are prioritised

Tasks are prioritised in terms of how much they contribute to our 3 main website
goals: 

1. Persuade people about:
  - the gravity and urgency of the climate and ecological crisis.
  - the need of XR and its tactics to get governments to address this crisis.
  - the importance of them joining XR in order to help address this crisis
2. Make it very easy for new people to get actively involved in XR. ‘Actively
   involved’ means that they either attend XR events, participate in actions,
   volunteer within the movement or donate.
3. Keep rebels engaged within the movement through content such as press
   releases, blogs, rebel radio...

## Change the website content

Since this website is developed in Wordpress, you can change most of the text
and images of the website using the Wordpress editor. To access the Wordpress
editor of the website you'll need to log in the [website admin
page](https://extinctionrebellion.nl/wp/wp-admin/) using your account, which you can
obtain by [contacting us](/SUPPORT.md).

The best way to undestand how the Wordpress editor works is to try to change
some content and then to see a preview of your changes by clicking `see edits`
under the `publish` panel on the right. If you want to learn more about how to
master the Wordpress editor you can see one of the many good tutorials that you
can find online, or ask us directly.

### Translating website content

When changing the website content it is important (and often forgotten) to
change the content in both languages of the website. You can do this by clicking
on the `translate this document` button in the `language` panel on the top right
of the editor.
